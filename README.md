Any feedbacks or request are welcome, do it quick when I still have passion on this.

this tool works on reforged and eb(run as admin)
unlike wfe, this one simulate the real input of user instead of altering ram for wc3 only

tool auto disable on pressing enter(ingame chat) and re-enable after pressing enter/esc/left click again(finish ingame chat)

unlike wfe it cant detect if ur in lobby or ingame, so better disable it with f2 when ur in lobby

## Loader
click any of ur savefile and then click load  
or in game type -l / -load will load ur selected savefile  
or in game type -ll / -loadlast will load ur last loaded savefile  
after load will save the history of ur last loaded savefile

can drag and drop new save file into ui  
right click save file can hide unwanted saves

## remap keyboard

Original spells are the current wc3 spell hotkeys on ur bot right UI grid

New spells are the one u want to press to send the corresponding hotkey to wc3

Original Inventory hotkeys are  
numpad7 numpad8  
numpad4 numpad5  
numpad1 numpad2

mouse hotkeys u know  
left and right click

**control**  
click on the button box to remove then click any key or key combination on keyboard to register a new one

right click button box to enable/disable quickcast (left click after pressing hotkey)

**note**

original keys can be any single key, just make sure they match ur wc3, leaving them empty will result new remaped key sending empty key
